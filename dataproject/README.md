# Data analysis project

My project is titled **Testing Black-Scholes model with historical S&P500 data** and is about testing a certain model used for pricing financial derivatives (options). The model is quite simple, compared to other models and in this project, I will test its accuracy by comparing its predictions to actual options prices.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

I apply the **following datasets**:

1. dataX.csv (*Yahoo Finance*) 
2. dataY.csv (*Yahoo Finance*)
3. Vix.csv (*Yahoo Finance*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
