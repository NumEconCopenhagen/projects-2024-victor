This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. I look at stock prices for the S&P500 index and Novo Nordisk and compare the two. I also use the Black-Scholes model to compute option prices.
3. Model project. I model the Black-Scholes model and Heston stochastic volatility model by using historical options data from the S&P500.
4. Exam project.
