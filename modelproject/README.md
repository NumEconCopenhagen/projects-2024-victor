# Model analysis project

My project is titled **Black-Scholes & Heston model** and is about calculating options prices in two different models. The Black-Scholes model is the simple model and assumes constant volatility and the Heston model assumes that the level of volatility follows a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
